Log files:
The first place to look if something goes wrong.

Access log:evers.pythonanywhere.com.access.log

Files that aren't dynamically generated by your code, like CSS, JavaScript or uploaded files, can be served much faster straight off the disk if you specify them here. You need to Reload your web app to activate any changes you make to the mappings below.
